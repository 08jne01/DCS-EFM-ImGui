# DCS EFM ImGui

## Building:
To use the D3DHook.h and D3DHook.cpp source files, they included in the user's
EFM Visual Studio or CMake project. The user will need to have the
"Desktop development with C++" and "Game development with C++" Visual Studio
workloads installed to successful build these source files.

The source files use the ImGui and MinHook libraries.

## Examples:
Below is a simple example of the D3DHook's usage:
```C++

```
More in-depth examples can be found in the Examples/ directory of this
repository.

## Note:
Please do not use these source files maliciously. This code is meant to aide the
user in developing an EFM with the powerful ImGui widgets library.

These source files were builded and tested using Visual Studio Community 2022,
Windows 10 SDK Version _____, the C++20 Standard, the MinHook library version
_____, the DirectX SDK Version _____, and the ImGui library version _____.
